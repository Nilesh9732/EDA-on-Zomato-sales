# Exploratory Data Analysis project 
This EDA project is made on Jupyter Notebook-7.0.8 by using Python.

## Libraries used
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplplotlib
- Seaborn

## Roadmap
- Data Collection and Import using Pandas.
- Use pandas to handle missing values, correct data types, and remove duplicates for a clean dataset.
- Utilize pandas and numpy to perform descriptive statistics and understand data distributions.
- Create visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to identify trends, patterns, and correlations in the sales data.
- Summarize findings and insights, supported by visualizations, to inform data-driven decisions.

## Objective
The objective is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Zomato sales using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. This involves collecting and cleaning data, exploring data characteristics, visualizing trends and patterns, and deriving insights to support data-driven decision-making.
